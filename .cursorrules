// Basic cursor rules

// AgentInit Rules
// The following rules have been applied by AgentInit:

// - Always initialize a Git repository if one doesn't exist (git init)
// - Make atomic commits with clear, descriptive commit messages
// - Use conventional commit format: type(scope): description
// - Create feature branches for new work, don't work directly on main/master
// - Never commit sensitive data, API keys, or secrets to the repository
// - Review changes with `git diff --staged` before committing
// - Keep commits focused on a single logical change
// - Use meaningful branch names that describe the feature or fix
// - Write tests for all new functionality before or during implementation
// - Don't use mocks unless absolutely necessary - prefer real implementations
// - Test edge cases, error conditions, and boundary values
// - Maintain a minimum of 80% code coverage for all new code
// - Run the full test suite before committing changes
// - Write both unit tests for individual components and integration tests
// - Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested
// - Test the actual behavior users will experience, not just implementation details
// - Run tsc tests.

// Rules managed by AgentInit. Do not edit this section manually.
