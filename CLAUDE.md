# Agent Configuration for agentinit

**Stack**: typescript
**Generated**: 2025-08-15
**Package Manager**: npm
**Existing Agents**: none

## Project Context

This is a typescript project. The codebase follows modern development practices with automated testing using jest.

## Development Guidelines

### Code Quality
- Write clean, maintainable code following typescript best practices
- Use TypeScript for type safety when applicable
- Follow consistent naming conventions
- Add comments for complex logic

### Testing Strategy
- Write unit tests for all business logic using jest
- Aim for high test coverage (>80%)
- Include integration tests for critical paths
- Test edge cases and error scenarios

### Git Workflow
- Use conventional commit messages
- Create meaningful commit messages that explain the "why"
- Keep commits atomic and focused
- Use feature branches for new functionality

## Agent Instructions

### General Behavior
- Always analyze the existing codebase before making changes
- Follow the project's established patterns and conventions
- Ask for clarification when requirements are ambiguous
- Provide clear explanations for design decisions

### Code Changes
- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones
- Maintain consistency with existing code style
- Add appropriate error handling
- Update tests when modifying functionality

### Security & Best Practices
- Never expose sensitive information in code or logs
- Follow security best practices for typescript
- Validate all inputs
- Use environment variables for configuration

## Sub-Agents

### Code Reviewer
**Role**: Review code for quality, security, and best practices
**Focus Areas**:
- Code complexity and maintainability

## CLI Tool Specific Guidelines

### Command Design
- Follow Unix philosophy (do one thing well)
- Provide helpful error messages
- Support common flags (--help, --version, --verbose)
- Use consistent command naming
- Implement proper exit codes

### User Interface

- Use colors and formatting appropriately
- Show progress for long-running operations
- Support both interactive and non-interactive modes
- Handle interrupts gracefully

### Configuration

- Document all configuration options


## Additional Claude-Specific Instructions

- Use Claude's long-form thinking when needed for complex problems
- Provide detailed explanations for complex code
- Break down large tasks into smaller, manageable steps
- Use Claude's code analysis capabilities effectively

## Rules System

AgentInit provides a rules system to apply coding best practices and standards. Rules can be applied using:

```bash
# Apply rule templates to this project
agentinit apply --rules git,write_tests,use_linter

# Add custom rules
agentinit apply --rule-raw "Use functional programming patterns"

# Load rules from file
agentinit apply --rules-file ./team-standards.md

# Apply globally to all Claude projects
agentinit apply --global --agent claude --rules git,write_docs
```

**Available Rule Templates:**
- `git` - Git workflow enforcement and commit standards
- `write_docs` - Comprehensive documentation requirements
- `use_git_worktrees` - Parallel development with Git worktrees
- `use_subagents` - Delegate specialized work to subagents
- `use_linter` - Code quality and formatting enforcement
- `write_tests` - Test-driven development practices

Rules are automatically merged and managed in the section below. They can be updated by running new `agentinit apply --rules` commands.

## AgentInit Rules

The following rules have been applied by AgentInit:

- Always initialize a Git repository if one doesn't exist (git init)
- Make atomic commits with clear, descriptive commit messages
- Use conventional commit format: type(scope): description
- Create feature branches for new work, don't work directly on main/master
- Never commit sensitive data, API keys, or secrets to the repository
- Review changes with `git diff --staged` before committing
- Keep commits focused on a single logical change
- Use meaningful branch names that describe the feature or fix
- Write tests for all new functionality before or during implementation
- Don't use mocks unless absolutely necessary - prefer real implementations
- Test edge cases, error conditions, and boundary values
- Maintain a minimum of 80% code coverage for all new code
- Run the full test suite before committing changes
- Write both unit tests for individual components and integration tests
- Use descriptive test names that explain what is being tested
- Test the actual behavior users will experience, not just implementation details
- Run tsc tests.
